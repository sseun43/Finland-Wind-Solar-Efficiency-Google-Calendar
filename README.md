# Finland-Wind-Solar-Efficiency-Google-Calendar
This project displays the percentage of the total wind/solar capacity that is currently being produced into the Finnish grid using google calender. 

For example 50% means that finland is currently producing only half of its' total solar/wind energy capacity. 
This knowledge can help you to plan the best time to consume green energy in Finland in situation where Finland produces excess energy than it can consume
